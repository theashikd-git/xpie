## Overview

Xpie is a simple yet functional IT management system developed using PHP and MySQL. It allows administrators to log in securely and manage the following areas from a single interface: asset inventory, asset reporting, IP/VLAN allocation, and a wishlist for procurement requests. The system was built as part of an academic project to demonstrate full-stack web development skills using core web technologies.
